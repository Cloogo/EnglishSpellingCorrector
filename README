An English spelling corrector.

Install and run:
cd build
../configure
make
cd src/core
./SpellCorrector speling
Do you mean "spelling"?

An exercise on how to use autotools and gprof.
With the help of gprof,i have found the hot spot:Args_get() and Hashtable_get().
In order to deal with Hashtable_get(),i comment some codes.It proves to be right.
As for Args_get(),it is of poor efficiency.Optimize my code!(I try to replace strchr() in Args_get() with exists()).

Compared to the header i have used in EnglishSpellChecker,
file.c changes a little,considering data encapsulation.
